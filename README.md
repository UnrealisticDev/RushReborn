## Motivation

The original Kingdom Rush was *the game* that inspired me to pursue software development in the first place. It took the crowded tower defense genre and applied a level of detail and polish that few have matched (but see the App/Play Store for many lesser clones). I dabbled with recreating this game many times, first with SDL, then with Cocos2D (which the original was made with), and a variety of other softwares. None of these efforts made it out of the starting gate. Kingdom Rush, while seemingly trivial on the surface, has surprisingly complex mechanics.

Years later, and as a much more mature developer, I decided to tackle the project once more, this time with Unreal Engine 4. The tower defense genre is great for demonstrating gameplay programming skills because it has very well-defined patterns (e.g. towers, wave-based spawning). For the same reason, I wanted to target an existing game (Kingdom Rush) instead of creating one from scratch, because this would allow me to focus exclusively on implementation without worrying about design.

Shoutout to Ironhide Studios for creating this masterpiece.
